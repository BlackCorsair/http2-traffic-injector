# First Tutorship *17/03/2020*
## Notes
- State clearly the reasons to develop in C++:
  - Day by day usage and knowledge
  - Easily extensible within the company as everyone has good skills
  - Other evaluated technologies add complexity:
    - Scala: It must be integrated with Java library to make use of the HTTP2 library
    - Rust: Not completely object-oriented and not completely mature HTTP2 library
- Separate clearly unit tests and system tests. Make a top-level test to verify the non-funtional requirements even 
if it is not a complete e2e test (save the interfaces and the protocol stack).
- Prepare a Sprint-0 in order to prepare a "Enough Design"
- Explain in the memory the benefits of mixing up the Enough Design with the XP methodology and TDD.
  - Be able to develop bottom-up
  - Search for an automatic tool to make diagrams of every commit in order to see how the class hierachy is changing
  with time and so compare it to the original design.
- Prepare planning (5 iterations of 2 weeks)
- Documentation must be updated during the whole project
- Reserve at least one iteration for the project documentation
